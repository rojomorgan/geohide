# geohide
We have created a Drupal module (PHP) for a specific functionality that we have not previously found: Geolocalize a visitor via an external query to an IP location service and hide any given field depending on node's title. Initially for Drupal 7 but we anticipate that we'll update and adapt it soon for Drupal 8.
